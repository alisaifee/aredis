API Reference
=============

Encoding/Decoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Param :paramref:`~coredis.Redis.encoding` and :paramref:`~coredis.Redis.decode_responses`
are used to support response encoding.

``encoding`` is used for specifying with which encoding you want responses to be decoded.
``decode_responses`` is used for tell the client whether responses should be decoded.

If ``decode_responses`` is set to ``True`` and no encoding is specified, client will use ``utf-8`` by default.

Connections
^^^^^^^^^^^

ConnectionPools manage a set of Connection instances. coredis ships with two
types of Connections. The default, Connection, is a normal TCP socket based
connection. The :class:`~coredis.connection.UnixDomainSocketConnection` allows
for clients running on the same device as the server to connect via a unix domain socket.
To use a :class:`~coredis.connection.UnixDomainSocketConnection` connection,
simply pass the :paramref:`~coredis.Redis.unix_socket_path` argument,
which is a string to the unix domain socket file.

Additionally, make sure the parameter is defined in your redis.conf file. It's
commented out by default.

.. code-block:: python

    r = coredis.Redis(unix_socket_path='/tmp/redis.sock')

You can create your own Connection subclasses as well. This may be useful if
you want to control the socket behavior within an async framework. To
instantiate a client class using your own connection, you need to create
a connection pool, passing your class to the connection_class argument.
Other keyword parameters you pass to the pool will be passed to the class
specified during initialization.

.. code-block:: python

    pool = coredis.ConnectionPool(connection_class=YourConnectionClass,
                                    your_arg='...', ...)

Parsers
^^^^^^^

Parser classes provide a way to control how responses from the Redis server
are parsed. coredis ships with two parser classes, the PythonParser and the
HiredisParser. By default, coredis will attempt to use the HiredisParser if
you have the hiredis module installed and will fallback to the PythonParser
otherwise.

Hiredis is a C library maintained by the core Redis team. Pieter Noordhuis was
kind enough to create Python bindings. Using Hiredis can provide up to a
10x speed improvement in parsing responses from the Redis server. The
performance increase is most noticeable when retrieving many pieces of data,
such as from LRANGE or SMEMBERS operations.


Hiredis is available on PyPI, and can be installed as an extra dependency to
coredis.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install coredis[hiredis]


=====
RESP3
=====
.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

As of redis `6.0.0` clients can use the
`RESP3 <https://github.com/antirez/RESP3/blob/master/spec.md>`__ protocol which
provides support for a much larger set of types (which reduces the need for clients
to "guess" what the type of a command's response should be). Hiredis versions `>=2.0.0`
supports ``RESP3`` and **coredis** provides the option to use it both with hiredis
and the pure python parser.  The structure of responses of from coredis is consistent
between ``RESP`` (``protocol_version=2``) and ``RESP3`` (``protocol_version=3``) protocols.

To opt in the :paramref:`~coredis.Redis.protocol_version` constructor parameter
can be set to ``3``.

.. code-block:: python

    r = coredis.Redis(protocol_version=3)

LUA Scripting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

coredis supports the EVAL, EVALSHA, and SCRIPT commands. However, there are
a number of edge cases that make these commands tedious to use in real world
scenarios. Therefore, coredis exposes a Script object that makes scripting
much easier to use.

To create a Script instance, use the `register_script` function on a client
instance passing the LUA code as the first argument. `register_script` returns
a Script instance that you can use throughout your code.

The following trivial LUA script accepts two parameters: the name of a key and
a multiplier value. The script fetches the value stored in the key, multiplies
it with the multiplier value and returns the result.

.. code-block:: python

    r = coredis.Redis()
    lua = """
    local value = redis.call('GET', KEYS[1])
    value = tonumber(value)
    return value * ARGV[1]"""
    multiply = r.register_script(lua)

`multiply` is now a Script instance that is invoked by calling it like a
function. Script instances accept the following optional arguments:

* **keys**: A list of key names that the script will access. This becomes the
  KEYS list in LUA.
* **args**: A list of argument values. This becomes the ARGV list in LUA.
* **client**: A coredis Client or Pipeline instance that will invoke the
  script. If client isn't specified, the client that intiially
  created the Script instance (the one that `register_script` was
  invoked from) will be used.

Notice that the `Srcipt.__call__` is no longer useful(`async/await` can't be used in magic method),
please use `Script.register` instead

Continuing the example from above:

.. code-block:: python

    await r.set('foo', 2)
    await multiply.execute(keys=['foo'], args=[5])
    # 10

The value of key 'foo' is set to 2. When multiply is invoked, the 'foo' key is
passed to the script along with the multiplier value of 5. LUA executes the
script and returns the result, 10.

Script instances can be executed using a different client instance, even one
that points to a completely different Redis server.

.. code-block:: python

    r2 = coredis.Redis('redis2.example.com')
    await r2.set('foo', 3)
    multiply.execute(keys=['foo'], args=[5], client=r2)
    # 15

The Script object ensures that the LUA script is loaded into Redis's script
cache. In the event of a NOSCRIPT error, it will load the script and retry
executing it.

Script objects can also be used in pipelines. The pipeline instance should be
passed as the client argument when calling the script. Care is taken to ensure
that the script is registered in Redis's script cache just prior to pipeline
execution.

.. code-block:: python

    pipe = await r.pipeline()
    await pipe.set('foo', 5)
    await multiply(keys=['foo'], args=[5], client=pipe)
    await pipe.execute()
    # [True, 25]

Pipelines
^^^^^^^^^^

Pipelines expose an API "similar" to :class:`~coredis.Redis` with the exception
that calling any redis command returns the pipeline instance itself.

To retrieve the actual results of each command queued in the pipeline you must call
:meth:`~coredis.commands.pipeline.Pipeline.execute`

For example:


.. code-block:: python

    async def example(client):
        async with await client.pipeline() as pipe:
            await pipe.delete(['bar'])
            await pipe.set('bar', 'foo')
            await pipe.execute()  # needs to be called explicitly


Here are more examples:


.. code-block:: python

    async def example(client):
        async with await client.pipeline(transaction=True) as pipe:
            # will return self to send another command
            pipe = await (await pipe.flushdb()).set('foo', 'bar')
            # can also directly send command
            await pipe.set('bar', 'foo')
            # commands will be buffered
            await pipe.keys('*')
            res = await pipe.execute()
            # results should be in order corresponding to your command
            assert res == (True, True, True, set([b'bar', b'foo']))

For ease of use, all commands being buffered into the pipeline return the
pipeline object itself. Which enable you to use it like the example provided.

In addition, pipelines can also ensure the buffered commands are executed
atomically as a group. This happens by default. If you want to disable the
atomic nature of a pipeline but still want to buffer commands, you can turn
off transactions.

.. code-block:: python

    pipe = r.pipeline(transaction=False)

A common issue occurs when requiring atomic transactions but needing to
retrieve values in Redis prior for use within the transaction. For instance,
let's assume that the INCR command didn't exist and we need to build an atomic
version of ``INCR`` in Python.

The completely naive implementation could GET the value, increment it in
Python, and ``SET`` the new value back. However, this is not atomic because
multiple clients could be doing this at the same time, each getting the same
value from ``GET``.

Enter the ``WATCH`` command. ``WATCH`` provides the ability to monitor one or more keys
prior to starting a transaction. If any of those keys change prior the
execution of that transaction, the entire transaction will be canceled and a
WatchError will be raised. To implement our own client-side INCR command, we
could do something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    async def example():
        async with await r.pipeline() as pipe:
            while True:
                try:
                    # put a WATCH on the key that holds our sequence value
                    await pipe.watch('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY')
                    # after WATCHing, the pipeline is put into immediate execution
                    # mode until we tell it to start buffering commands again.
                    # this allows us to get the current value of our sequence
                    current_value = await pipe.get('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY')
                    next_value = int(current_value) + 1
                    # now we can put the pipeline back into buffered mode with MULTI
                    pipe.multi()
                    pipe.set('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY', next_value)
                    # and finally, execute the pipeline (the set command)
                    await pipe.execute()
                    # if a WatchError wasn't raised during execution, everything
                    # we just did happened atomically.
                    break
                except WatchError:
                    # another client must have changed 'OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY' between
                    # the time we started WATCHing it and the pipeline's execution.
                    # our best bet is to just retry.
                    continue

Note that, because the Pipeline must bind to a single connection for the
duration of a WATCH, care must be taken to ensure that the connection is
returned to the connection pool by calling the reset() method. If the
Pipeline is used as a context manager (as in the example above) :meth:`~coredis.Pipeline.reset`
will be called automatically. Of course you can do this the manual way by
explicitly calling :meth:`~coredis.Pipeline.reset`:

.. code-block:: python

    async def example():
        async with await r.pipeline() as pipe:
            while 1:
                try:
                    await pipe.watch('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY')
                    ...
                    await pipe.execute()
                    break
                except WatchError:
                    continue
                finally:
                    await pipe.reset()

A convenience method named "transaction" exists for handling all the
boilerplate of handling and retrying watch errors. It takes a callable that
should expect a single parameter, a pipeline object, and any number of keys to
be ``WATCH``ed. Our client-side ``INCR`` command above can be written like this,
which is much easier to read:

.. code-block:: python

    async def client_side_incr(pipe):
        current_value = await pipe.get('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY')
        next_value = int(current_value) + 1
        pipe.multi()
        await pipe.set('OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY', next_value)

    await r.transaction(client_side_incr, 'OUR-SEQUENCE-KEY')
    # [True]


Publish / Subscribe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

coredis includes a :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub` class
that subscribes to channels and listens for new messages. Creating a :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub` instance
can be done through the :meth:`~coredis.Redis.pubsub` or :meth:`~coredis.RedisCluster.pubsub` methods.

.. code-block:: python

    r = coredis.Redis(...)
    p = r.pubsub()

Once a :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub` instance is created,
channels and patterns can be subscribed to.

.. code-block:: python

    await p.subscribe('my-first-channel', 'my-second-channel', ...)
    await p.psubscribe('my-*', ...)

The :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub` instance is now subscribed to those channels/patterns. The
subscription confirmations can be seen by reading messages from the :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub`
instance.

.. code-block:: python

    await p.get_message()
    # {'pattern': None, 'type': 'subscribe', 'channel': 'my-second-channel', 'data': 1L}
    await p.get_message()
    # {'pattern': None, 'type': 'subscribe', 'channel': 'my-first-channel', 'data': 2L}
    await p.get_message()
    # {'pattern': None, 'type': 'psubscribe', 'channel': 'my-*', 'data': 3L}

Every message read from a :class:`~coredis.commands.pubsub.PubSub` instance
will be a dictionary with the following keys.

type
   One of the following: ``subscribe``, ``unsubscribe``, ``psubscribe``,
   ``punsubscribe``, ``message``, ``pmessage``

channel
   The channel [un]subscribed to or the channel a message was
   published to

pattern
   The pattern that matched a published message's channel. Will be
   ``None`` in all cases except for 'pmessage' types.

data
   The message data. With [un]subscribe messages, this value will be
   the number of channels and patterns the connection is currently subscribed
   to. With [p]message messages, this value will be the actual published
   message.

Let's send a message now.

.. code-block:: python

    # the publish method returns the number matching channel and pattern
    # subscriptions. 'my-first-channel' matches both the 'my-first-channel'
    # subscription and the 'my-*' pattern subscription, so this message will
    # be delivered to 2 channels/patterns
    await r.publish('my-first-channel', 'some data')
    # 2
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-first-channel', 'data': 'some data', 'pattern': None, 'type': 'message'}
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-first-channel', 'data': 'some data', 'pattern': 'my-*', 'type': 'pmessage'}

Unsubscribing works just like subscribing. If no arguments are passed to
[p]unsubscribe, all channels or patterns will be unsubscribed from.

.. code-block:: python

    await p.unsubscribe()
    await p.punsubscribe('my-*')
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-second-channel', 'data': 2L, 'pattern': None, 'type': 'unsubscribe'}
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-first-channel', 'data': 1L, 'pattern': None, 'type': 'unsubscribe'}
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-*', 'data': 0L, 'pattern': None, 'type': 'punsubscribe'}

coredis also allows you to register callback functions to handle published
messages. Message handlers take a single argument, the message, which is a
dictionary just like the examples above. To subscribe to a channel or pattern
with a message handler, pass the channel or pattern name as a keyword argument
with its value being the callback function.

When a message is read on a channel or pattern with a message handler, the
message dictionary is created and passed to the message handler. In this case,
a ``None`` value is returned from get_message() since the message was already
handled.

.. code-block:: python

    def my_handler(message):
        print('MY HANDLER: ', message['data'])
    await p.subscribe(**{'my-channel': my_handler})
    # read the subscribe confirmation message
    await p.get_message()
    # {'pattern': None, 'type': 'subscribe', 'channel': 'my-channel', 'data': 1L}
    await r.publish('my-channel', 'awesome data')
    # 1

    # for the message handler to work, we need tell the instance to read data.
    # this can be done in several ways (read more below). we'll just use
    # the familiar get_message() function for now
    await message = p.get_message()
    # 'MY HANDLER:  awesome data'

    # note here that the my_handler callback printed the string above.
    # `message` is None because the message was handled by our handler.
    print(message)
    # None

If your application is not interested in the (sometimes noisy)
subscribe/unsubscribe confirmation messages, you can ignore them by passing
`ignore_subscribe_messages=True` to `r.pubsub()`. This will cause all
subscribe/unsubscribe messages to be read, but they won't bubble up to your
application.

.. code-block:: python

    p = r.pubsub(ignore_subscribe_messages=True)
    await p.subscribe('my-channel')
    await p.get_message()  # hides the subscribe message and returns None
    await r.publish('my-channel')
    # 1
    await p.get_message()
    # {'channel': 'my-channel', 'data': 'my data', 'pattern': None, 'type': 'message'}

There are three different strategies for reading messages.

The examples above have been using `pubsub.get_message()`.
If there's data available to be read, `get_message()` will
read it, format the message and return it or pass it to a message handler. If
there's no data to be read, `get_message()` will return None after the configured `timeout`
(`timeout` should set to value larger than 0 or it will be ignore).
This makes it trivial to integrate into an existing event loop inside your application.

.. code-block:: python

    while True:
        message = await p.get_message()
        if message:
            # do something with the message
        await asyncio.sleep(0.001)  # be nice to the system :)

Older versions of coredis only read messages with `pubsub.listen()`. listen()
is a generator that blocks until a message is available. If your application
doesn't need to do anything else but receive and act on messages received from
redis, listen() is an easy way to get up an running.

.. code-block:: python

    for message in await p.listen():
        # do something with the message

The third option runs an event loop in a separate thread.
`pubsub.run_in_thread()` creates a new thread and use the event loop in main thread.
The thread object is returned to the caller of `run_in_thread()`. The caller can
use the `thread.stop()` method to shut down the event loop and thread. Behind
the scenes, this is simply a wrapper around `get_message()` that runs in a
separate thread, and use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to run coroutines.

Note: Since we're running in a separate thread, there's no way to handle
messages that aren't automatically handled with registered message handlers.
Therefore, coredis prevents you from calling `run_in_thread()` if you're
subscribed to patterns or channels that don't have message handlers attached.

.. code-block:: python

    await p.subscribe(**{'my-channel': my_handler})
    thread = p.run_in_thread(sleep_time=0.001)
    # the event loop is now running in the background processing messages
    # when it's time to shut it down...
    thread.stop()

PubSub objects remember what channels and patterns they are subscribed to. In
the event of a disconnection such as a network error or timeout, the
PubSub object will re-subscribe to all prior channels and patterns when
reconnecting. Messages that were published while the client was disconnected
cannot be delivered. When you're finished with a PubSub object, call its
`.close()` method to shutdown the connection.

.. code-block:: python

    p = r.pubsub()
    ...
    p.close()

The PUBSUB set of subcommands CHANNELS, NUMSUB and NUMPAT are also
supported:

.. code-block:: python

    await r.pubsub_channels()
    # ['foo', 'bar']
    await r.pubsub_numsub('foo', 'bar')
    # [('foo', 9001), ('bar', 42)]
    await r.pubsub_numsub('baz')
    # [('baz', 0)]
    await r.pubsub_numpat()
    # 1204

Distributed Locking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two kinds of `Lock class` available:

- :class:`~coredis.lock.Lock` [Using :ref:`api_reference:pipelines`]
- :class:`~coredis.lock.LuaLock` [Using :ref:`api_reference:lua scripting`]

A lock can be acquired using the :meth:`coredis.Redis.lock` or :meth:`coredis.RedisCluster.lock`
methods.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   async def example():
       client = coredis.Redis()
       await client.flushall()
       lock = client.lock('lalala')
       print(await lock.acquire())
       # True
       print(await lock.acquire(blocking=False))
       # False
       print(await lock.release())
       # None
       try:
           await lock.release()
       except LockError as err:
           print(err)
           # coredis.exceptions.LockError: Cannot release an unlocked lock


============
Cluster Lock
============

:class:`~coredis.lock.ClusterLock` is supposed to solve distributed lock problem
in redis cluster. Since high availability is provided by redis cluster using master-slave model,
the kind of lock aims to solve the fail-over problem referred in distributed lock
post given by redis official. This implementation isGjjk

Quoting the documentation from the original author of :pypi:`aredis`:

    Why not use Redlock algorithm provided by official directly?

    It is impossible to make a key hashed to different nodes
    in a redis cluster and hard to generate keys
    in a specific rule and make sure they do not migrated in cluster.
    In the worst situation, all key slots may exists in one node.
    Then the availability will be the same as one key in one node.

    For more discussion please see:
    https://github.com/NoneGG/aredis/issues/55

    To gather more ideas i also raise a problem in stackoverflow:
    Not_a_Golfer's solution is awesome, but considering the migration problem, i think this solution may be better.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46438857/how-to-create-a-distributed-lock-using-redis-cluster

    My solution is described below:

    1. random token + SETNX + expire time to acquire a lock in cluster master node

    2. if lock is acquired successfully then check the lock in slave nodes(may there be N slave nodes)
    using READONLY mode, if N/2+1 is synced successfully then break the check and return True,
    time used to check is also accounted into expire time

    3.Use lua script described in redlock algorithm to release lock
    with the client which has the randomly generated token,
    if the client crashes, then wait until the lock key expired.

    Actually you can regard the algorithm as a master-slave version of redlock,
    which is designed for multi master nodes.

    Please read these article below before using this cluster lock in your app.

        lock = client.lock('lalala', lock_class=ClusterLock, timeout=1)
        print(await lock.acquire())
        # True
        print(await lock.acquire(blocking=False))
        # False
        print(await lock.release())

            # coredis.exceptions.LockError: cannot release an unlocked lock


Typing
^^^^^^
**coredis** provides type hints for the public API. These are tested using
both :pypi:`mypy` and :pypi:`pyright`.

The :class:`Redis` and :class:`RedisCluster` clients are Generic types constrained
by :class:`AnyStr`. The constructors and ``from_url`` factory methods infer
the appropriate specialization automatically.

Without decoding:

.. code-block::

    client = coredis.Redis(
        "localhost", 6379, db=0, decode_responses=False, encoding="utf-8"
    )
    await client.set("string", 1)
    await client.lpush("list", [1])
    await client.hset("hash", {"a": 1})
    await client.sadd("set", ["a"])
    await client.zadd("sset", {"a": 1.0, "b": 2.0})

    str_response = await client.get("string")
    list_response_ = await client.lrange("list", 0, 1)
    hash_response = await client.hgetall("hash")
    set_response = await client.smembers("set")
    sorted_set_members_only_response = await client.zrange("sset", -1, 1)

    reveal_locals()
    # note: Revealed local types are:
    # note:     client: coredis.client.Redis[builtins.bytes]
    # note:     hash_response: builtins.dict*[builtins.bytes*, builtins.bytes*]
    # note:     list_response_: builtins.list*[builtins.bytes*]
    # note:     set_response: builtins.set*[builtins.bytes*]
    # note:     sorted_set_members_only_response: builtins.tuple*[builtins.bytes*, ...]
    # note:     str_response: builtins.bytes*

With decoding:

.. code-block::

    client = coredis.Redis(
        "localhost", 6379, db=0, decode_responses=True, encoding="utf-8"
    )
    await client.set("string", 1)

Runtime Type checking
=====================

.. danger:: Experimental feature

**coredis** optionally wraps all command methods with :pypi:`beartype` decorators to help
detect errors during testing (or if you are b(ea)rave enough, always).

This can be enabled by installing :pypi:`beartype` and setting the :data:`COREDIS_RUNTIME_CHECKS`
environment variable.

As an example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ COREDIS_RUNTIME_CHECKS=1 python -c "
    import coredis
    import asyncio
    asyncio.new_event_loop().run_until_complete(coredis.Redis().set(1,1))
    """
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<@beartype(coredis.commands.core.CoreCommands.set) at 0x10c403130>", line 33, in set
    beartype.roar.BeartypeCallHintParamViolation: @beartyped coroutine CoreCommands.set() parameter key=1 violates type hint typing.Union[str, bytes], as 1 not str or bytes.
